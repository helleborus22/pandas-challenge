# Pandas-challenge
In this project, I created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data for a school district. I performed the following tasks to display trends in school performance.

- created a summary of the district key metrics, such as:      
*Total schools,
Total students,
Total budget,
Average math score,
Average reading score,
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math),
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading),
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading).*
- created a summary of each school key metrics, such as:    
*School name,
School type,
Total students,
Total school budget,
Per student budget,
Average math score,
Average reading score,
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math),
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading),
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading).*
- created a DataFrame that highlights the top-5 performing schools based on overall performance and including the following metrics: 
*School type,
Total students,
Total school budget,
Per student budget,
Average math score,
Average reading score,
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math),
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading),
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading).*
- created a DataFrame that highlights the bottom-5 performing schools based on overall performance and including the following metrics: 
*School type,
Total students,
Total school budget,
Per student budget,
Average math score,
Average reading score,
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math),
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading),
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading).*
- created a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
- created a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
- created a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student), including the following metrics: *Average math score, Average reading score,
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math),
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading), % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading).*
- created a table that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
- created a table that breaks down school performance based on school type (district or charter).
